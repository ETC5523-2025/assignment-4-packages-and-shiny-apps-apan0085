Run fast: launch SurNamExp::launch_app() filter, rank, summarise names frequency. Data inside: last_names two columns — Surname (character) Per_1000_Americans (numeric). Reproducible pipeline: dataset built script data-raw/ can regenerate update . Well-documented: functions data use roxygen2 docs; vignette shows usage interpretation. Typical workflow: pick subset → view plot/table → read summary stats → export cite results. Design choice: keep Shiny UI thin; put reusable logic small helper functions clarity testing.
